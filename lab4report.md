# Lab 4 report

This lab focuses on making changes to files in a github repository and pushing them to remote source control. Using vim, we try to make the process as fast as possible. 

1. Logging into ieng6 machine: `ssh asadwelkar@ieng6.ucsd.edu <enter>`
2. Cloning my fork from my Github account: `git clone git@github.com:ucsd-cse15l-s23/lab7.git <enter>`
3. Running the tests to see they fail: `bash test.sh <enter>`
4. Editing the code file: `43 j 11 l x i 2 <esc> : w q <enter>`
5. Running the tests to see they now succeed: `bash test.sh <enter>`
6. Committing changes to fork: `git add ListExamples.java <enter>`, then `git commit -m "fixed test" <enter>`, then `git push origin main <enter>`
